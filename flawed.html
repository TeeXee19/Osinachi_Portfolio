              <p>“What do you mean ‘my transaction slip is not available yet’?! You’re the one that told me to be here by four o’clock. Now I’m here and you’re telling me stories!”</p>
              <p>“Madam, please calm down. I told you it might be available by four o’clock. I never said it WILL be available,” I brimmed with fury. Apparently this bank teller thought I came here to be taught English lessons. </p>
              <p>“Come, do you think I’m here to play? Do you know where I had to leave to come to this bank? Do you know how hot it is outside? What sort of nonsense is this?” I wanted to say more but I really couldn’t. The fact that I had had nothing to eat all day was finally taking its toll on me. I sighed and buried my face in my palms. Who was I even kidding? Ranting wouldn’t get me anywhere. The slip wouldn’t be available today. I sighed again then left the counter without even a backward glance at the young man. I heard him mutter something about young women that their mothers hadn’t taught manners but I didn’t have the energy to even reply. I stepped through the metal detectors and into the hot harmattan sun. </p>
              <p>“Hello dear, good evening,” I turned to see a young man wearing a faded grey shirt and plain black trousers facing me, with a huge smile plastered on his face. <i>Where did this one come from now?</i></p>
             <p> “Yes?” I answered irritably.</p>
              <p>“Sorry for disturbing. The name is Tony. I noticed the teller in there annoyed you. Something about a transaction slip?”</p>
              <p>“And?” I don’t know why I was still listening to this guy. But something was keeping me there.</p>
              <p>“Well, I know a way of getting it for you very early tomorrow morning. I have a friend in this bank. I could call in a favour for you.” I looked at the young man again. His shirt wasn’t just faded, he hadn’t tucked it in and it was rumpled at the hem. His shoes were dusty brown. His hair was well cut but not very combed. His features were okay, brown eyes, normal nose... though his mouth seemed bigger than normal, hence the wide smile. Somehow the smile was still on his face. <i>How on earth could this person know anyone besides his mother?</i></p>
              <p>“You know someone that could help me?” I asked incredulously. He laughed a little and asked me,</p>
              <p>“Why do you sound shocked? You think I’m lying?”</p>
              <p>“I don’t know, I just―” He stopped me midway through my sentence.</p>
              <p>“It’s fine. Yes, I can help you. On one condition though.” I nearly rolled my eyes as I thought, <i>This is Nigeria. There is always a catch</i>. I shook my head, and then looked at him with a small smile on my face.</p>
              <p>“What condition?”</p>
              <p>“You come to fellowship with me.” That caught me off guard. Fellowship? He had to be kidding. But his features gave no sign that he was.</p>
              <p>“You’re serious?”</p>
              <p>“Yes.”</p>
              <p>“Oh.....kay. When? And where?” He looked at his watch.</p>
              <p>“In the next fifteen minutes actually... At our church office. We normally use the student’s multipurpose hall but we’re kinda having holiday services right now. Until students come back to school fully.”</p>
              <p>“What’s the name of your fellowship?”</p>
              <p>“Enduring Word Fellowship. So... are you coming? We’re kinda running late.”</p>
              <p>I don’t know why but I followed him. With two minutes to spare, we made it to his church office. It was a small, cozy rectangular room just beside a major eatery in school. The windows were open but the curtains were drawn down. There were chairs arranged in 5 rows behind a pulpit. About seven people were there already and they were all standing and praying. I smirked then thought <i>‘yea right. The righteous ones’</i>...although they didn’t exactly look the part. I always envisioned ‘church people’ as bible carrying doomsday preachers dressed in abominably large clothing. The youngsters here were all casually dressed, most on jeans and shirts and sneakers. It made little sense to me. A dark lady with an amazing smile ushered me to a seat on the second row. There was worship and praise session after the opening prayer then a tall guy, probably in his early twenties stood behind the pulpit and began to preach. </p>
              <p>Truth is I hardly heard half of what he preached. I just heard him intermittently and knew that I had no knowledge of God. I kept staring at every other person in the room. They were about twenty now and most of them were nodding and exclaiming “Preach on, Sir!” at intervals. Once in a while somebody will burst into tongues or laughter and all this seemed very normal to them. I looked at the guy behind the pulpit again. He was very attractive with a well ironed striped shirt on black trousers, coupled with a clean shaven beard and sparkling eyes...but all that handsomeness was preaching on the love of God and the need for a relationship with Him. I bent my head in shame. I called myself a child of God. But I didn’t know my Father. At that moment, the guy at the pulpit said in a clear baritone voice,</p>
              <p>“If you’re here and you want to receive Christ into your life, please just repeat after me...” I knelt down just as he began.</p>
              <p>“Oh God... I accept that I am a sinner... I believe that You sent Your Only Son, Jesus Christ to die for my sins... I accept Him in my life this evening... I make Him Lord and Saviour over my life... I give Him the reins to my life... Thank you Lord for coming into my life... In Jesus name we pray... Amen.”</p>
              <p>After the ‘Amen’, a peace I never knew existed flooded into me. I felt lighter suddenly. I don’t know what had happened but I know that I stood up from that kneeling position different from the person that had knelt down two minutes earlier.</p>
              <p>That was how I began to attend Enduring Word fellowship. I joined the ushering department and made new friends. We were like a family there. Everyone cared sincerely about the other person. It was beautiful for me, especially considering the fact that my parents saw any form of affection as weakness on their part so they were careful not to let their love show. The tall preacher guy was a pastor and his name was Michael, there was also another pastor, Pastor Gideon. He was the most unlikely person to be seen behind a pulpit. He had a small stature with deep set eyes and this boyish aura that never seemed to leave him, even when he was face down on the ground worshipping, and he did that a lot. Truthfully, I never felt anything overly spiritual again after that first evening in the church office. But I didn’t mind. Just having people that cared for me and a sort of purpose outside school activities was enough.</p>
              <p>Tony and I got close. He helped me with my anger issues, prayed with me, we studied scripture together and he helped me with other academic issues I had too. At a point, I realized we were way past the normal “brethren” relationship that existed in the fellowship. I decided to tell him about it one evening after bible study.</p>
              <p>“So... what is this important thing that we cannot talk about in church?” He asked and flashed his signature wide smile. We were in one of the eateries in school. I was still wearing my ushering uniform, blue shirt on a black skirt with a blue headband that I had taken off. He still had his ‘DEACON’ tag on.</p>
              <p>“I...uh...I just wanted to tell you something I’m noticing,” I didn’t know where to begin. I saw him as an elder brother but I couldn’t deny the feelings that were beginning to grow between us. I fiddled with the headband in my hand.</p>
              <p>“Continue talking. I’m listening.”</p>
              <p>“Well...the thing is... we aren’t just deacon and church member anymore...” What was I even saying? He probably thought I was just being silly. He was a deacon for crying out loud, there was no way he felt the same things I did.</p>
              <p>“And?” His answer shocked me. I looked at him closely before asking.</p>
              <p>“You’ve noticed?”</p>
              <p>He smiled then held my hands from across the table, “Lisa, it’s not wrong to develop feelings for someone. And yes, I do have feelings for you. It’s not an abomination. We’re human, we all feel things. It’s what we do with those feelings that make us different from each other.”</p>
              <p>“So what are we going to do about ours?” It was easier to talk now that I knew we were on the same page.</p>
              <p>“Nothing. We’ll let it grow.”</p>
              <p>“But deacons in church aren’t meant to be dating. And I don’t know if―”
              “Lisa, calm down. We aren’t dating. We just like each other. Nothing bad could possibly come from that. Relax,” and he mildly stroked my cheek. I smiled at him. </p>
              <p>“Well, whatever you say.”</p>
              <p>The next few weeks saw Tony and I getting closer and closer. Eyebrows were beginning to rise in church, but I didn’t see why they were all worried. We weren’t doing anything wrong. I never visited him unless a church member was with me and we always had our discussions in open spaces. There was really no reason to get worked up. Tony was a perfect gentleman with the fear of God in him.</p>
             <p> One Friday afternoon, I decided to go check up on him in his apartment. He hadn’t come for prayer meeting that morning and he wasn’t picking his calls. I was so worried that he’d fallen ill or something. When I got to his door, I knocked and seconds later, some girl opened it.</p>
              <p>“Uh...good afternoon. Is Tony around?” I tried my best to keep a straight face while talking to her. She had a peculiar, gooey smell on her that she’d tried unsuccessfully to hide behind cheap perfume. Her makeup was loud and excessive, like a call girl’s. She was wearing a short pink gown with a deep v-neck that did nothing to hide her cleavage.</p>
              <p>“He’s bathing,” she looked me over, “Are you the afternoon girl? What’s with the whole good girl getup? Oh well, different strokes for different folks. Just be careful, he’s a biter.” And with that, she was gone. I had very little idea of what she was talking about but even the little I knew was shocking me. I walked into the room and everywhere was in disarray, the bed especially. I never knew Tony to be a scattered person. Soon, he came out of the bathroom. For a split second, he looked shocked to see me but then he recovered with a smile.</p>
              <p>“Lisa. What a surprise. Why are you here?”</p>
              <p>“I came to know why you didn’t come to church,” I said and gingerly stepped over some clothes on the floor close to the door.</p>
              <p>“So you didn’t come to know how I’m doing? How heartbreaking. Come here, come give me a hug,” he said and held open his arms. His bare chest was glistening with drops of water and he just had a towel on. I shrank away from him. </p>
              <p>“What? No. Tony, are you okay?”</p>
              <p>“C’mon Lisa. It’s just a hug. There’s nothing wrong with it.”</p>
             <p> “Yes but... the circumstances. Someone could just walk in and see us and think something. Besides, it could... lead to something else.”</p>
              <p>“C’mon, nothing is gonna happen. My arms are hanging here. Do you really think I’ll do something wrong?” </p>
              <p>“No... But what if we... we...”</p>
              <p>“Lisa love, Romans 14:22― ‘... happy are those who do not feel guilty when they do something they judge is right.’ If you think it’s wrong, it is. But if you don’t, then it isn’t. Now come. My hug,” He smiled that his smile again and my resolve melted. I started walking towards him. </p>
              <p><i>“Don’t!”</i> I stopped dead in my tracks and turned. No one was behind me. I turned back to Tony. </p>
              <p>“Did you hear that?” </p>
              <p>“Hear what? Come here now.” His tone was laced with desperation. His eyes were twinkling with excitement, I had no idea why. Then I noticed the slight bulge below his waist. I stepped back.</p>
             <p> “I can’t.”</p>
              <p>“You can’t what? Come here now, this girl. Why are you even acting all holy? You think I don’t know you’re not a virgin, eh? All this nonsense holier than thou attitude,” He took a step toward me and I bolted. I didn’t even look back for one second. As I ran back to my hostel, I was shocked beyond words. Tony, of all people. What was the point of all the church activities? All the prayer meetings? I couldnt believe he could twist a Bible verse like that for his disgusting motives. I wondered how many poor, unsuspecting ladies had fallen prey to that. I made up my mind never to go back to church again.</p>
              <p>But just as I stepped into my room, my eyes caught the heading of a tract I had collected earlier that day <b>‘Never mistake human flaws for God flaws. God has no flaw.’</b></p>
