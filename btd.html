          Mummy was on the sofa, clutching her bag to her chest and staring blankly into
          space. My elder sister, Rose was on the floor, crying quietly, the pestle lying beside
          her. I was sitting on the chair closest to the door, the one Uncle Chime had always
          sat on… but he wasn’t sitting on it today. I looked at his body on the floor. His face
          was slowly beginning to look different; his skin was getting the look mine got when I
          didn’t rub Vaseline during harmattan period, all glassy like. He was still wearing the
          brown traditional attire. He looked like he was going to stand up any second and
          smile that his goofy smile at Mummy then take her somewhere nice so she could
          unwind. But the slowly increasing pool of blood under his head said otherwise. I
          never knew we had so much blood in our head. Why doesn’t it weigh us down? I
          looked at Mummy again... I wanted to blame her but I couldn’t. I couldn’t even blame
          Rose. I turned my gaze to Daddy’s picture on the wall. Maybe I should blame him. It
          would be easy to blame a dead person, besides if he hadn’t died, none of this
          would’ve happened.
            </p>
            <p>
               The first time I saw Uncle Chime, Mummy had come back from work with him. I
                remembered that day very clearly. I had heard mummy drive into the house and I ran
                to the front door to greet her and that was when I saw him. The tall, dark man
                dressed in plain black trousers and a tight shirt with buttons that were straining under
                the pressure of being closed over a slight potbelly. Standing beside Mummy and
                chatting so naturally, with a funny smile on his face.
             </p>
            <p>
              “Mummy, good afternoon... Uncle good afternoon,” I knew something was off.
              Mummy was always cranky when she got back from work. ‘A nurse in a Nigerian
              hospital is one of the most underappreciated professionals that ever existed’― these
              were her usual words when she got back. But not that day. That day, she’d come
              back happy.
            </p>
            <p>“Good afternoon dear. Is this Rose?” He’d asked Mummy. I then quipped up,</p>

            <p>“No, I’m Lisa. Rose is my elder sister,” the minute the words left my mouth, I
            regretted them. Mum hated us speaking when we have not been spoken to. She
            never really cared where we were, if any of her children did anything she didn’t agree
            with, she was gonna get a good beating at the spot... but as I said earlier, something
            was off. Mum just smiled at me then led him into the house like nothing happened.
            And that’s how Uncle Chime entered our lives.
            </p>
            <p>That day after he left, Mummy told us that he was a doctor that worked in the
            hospital she worked in and that was it. Then his visits became more frequent, daily
            even. Rose didn’t really like him, I guess she thought he was trying to fill up Daddy’s
            space in Mummy’s life. I really did not mind. He made Mummy happy and since he’d
            started coming, she had reduced the way she beat us and even her unnecessary
            shouting had stopped. Plus he bought us a lot of things anytime he came so it wasn’t
            such a bad situation to me. I didn’t remember Daddy much anyway; I was barely 5
            when he died.
            </p>
            <p>It was about 6 months later, when I entered Primary two and Rose got to SSS1, that
            things started turning sour. One Monday evening, he came back with Mummy from
            work as usual, but he didn’t go back to his house. Rose and I convinced ourselves
            that he just couldn’t leave that day for some good reason, but then the next day, he stayed back again. He slept in our house till Thursday evening before he left. Rose
            was furious. I don’t know what she was imagining in her head but it had to be very
            serious, enough to give her the guts to march to the parlour that Friday and ask
            Mummy what was going on.</p>
            <p>“Mummy, good evening,” She’d started. I couldn’t go with her so I just stood behind
            the door from the parlour leading to the bedroom corridor.</p>
            <p>“Yes Rose, is there anything?” Mummy’s face was buried in some papers she was
            holding. </p>
            <p>“Nothing mummy. I just wanted to know if there’s something wrong with Uncle’s
            house. Did his house get flooded or something?” subtlety had never been Rose’s
            strong suit. Mummy stopped reading and looked at Rose.
            </p>
            <p>“What did you just say?” It was back again. That voice she used when she was going
            to beat someone. Rose stepped back in fear.</p>

            <p>“I...it’s just...he’s been sleeping here... the neighbours might―” A deafening slap
            landed on Rose’s cheek. </p>
            <p>“And how is that your business?! Ehn...tell me! Jesus Christ, is this how I raised you,
            ehn? You’re now asking me questions, as onye nwe ulo,okwaya? 1 C’mon get out of
            my sight, idiot! Stupid ape!” That was the last time anyone raised the topic. Uncle
            Chime kept sleeping in our house till it became a routine. He’ll come back with mum
            after work on Monday then stay at our house and be leaving for work with her
            throughout the week. Thursday evenings, he’ll go back to his own house. Our house
            was on the ground floor of an apartment block so it was relatively small. There were
            just two bedrooms, a kitchen, a parlour then a toilet and bathroom. I usually slept
            with Mummy in the bigger bedroom she used to share with Daddy. But whenever
            Uncle Chime came, Mummy slept in the parlour with him. It was soon Christmas and
            we travelled to the village for a week. That whole week Mummy didn’t see Uncle
            Chime and she nearly blew her top whenever she shouted at us. </p>
            <p>After the Christmas holidays, Mummy decided that Rose wasn’t reading well at
            home, that a boarding school would be best for her. And that’s how Rose left her old
            school in the middle of the session and went to some missionary boarding school
            miles away from home. </p>
            <p>Uncle Chime began to spend weekends at home too. One night, I heard noises from
            the parlour where Mummy and Uncle Chime slept. I didn’t dare go to find out what it
            was. But I couldn’t go back to sleep. I lay on my bed and listened to the sounds all
            night. I didn’t know if they were watching something on TV but what I was hearing
            sounded so wrong and it made me cry. I don’t know when I slept but when I woke
            up, my pillow was soaked. I tried not to think about it but somehow, curiosity got the
            better of me and I asked Uncle Chime the next day when Mummy was cooking
            lunch. </p>
            <p>“Uncle?” He looked up from his phone and smiled calmly at me.</p>

            <p>“Yes, Lisa? What’s the problem?” His voice was so soothing, unlike mummy’s own.
            My confidence increased. Uncle Chime was too nice. He wouldn’t beat me for asking
            a question</p>
            <p>“Uncle, I heard noise coming from the parlour in the night. Were you people watching
            film without telling me?” I asked, giving him my best smile. Uncle Chime started coughing. I offered to get him water, but he refused. When he finished coughing, he
            smiled up at me again.</p>
            <p>“You know you shouldn’t be up so late. Yes, we were watching movies. Oya, go back
            to the kitchen and help Mummy, okay?”</p>
            <p>I nodded and went out of the parlour happy. But I was in for a shock later that
            evening. I was in the room I shared with Rose when my name rang out.</p>
            <p>“Monalisa!” Mummy never called your full name unless you had done something
            terrible. I crept quietly into the parlour, wondering what I had committed. She was
            sitting on the long sofa with Uncle Chime. The jollof rice she cooked was in front of
            them but it lay untouched. Mummy looked like she was going to kill me. </p>
            <p>“Ma?” I whispered. </p>
            <p>“What were you asking Uncle Chime this afternoon?” she asked in a menacing tone.
            Uncle Chime calmly placed a hand on her lap and said, </p>
            <p> “Mummy, you don’t need to―”</p>
            <p>“No! No, Daddy, don’t tell me that! It’s because you’re always smiling with these children, that’s why they have the guts to be asking you silly questions like this. What sort of question is that?” She was facing me now, “Ehn? I’m asking you! What sort of nonsense question did you ask him? Well, you know if you had come to me, I would have slapped sense into you! You’ve seen Uncle Chime now. He’s your mate. Foolish thing! Oya, go to my room and get your cane. It’s like you’re beginning to lose your sense in this house,” I walked in a daze to her room then searched under the bed for my cane. When I found it, I started crying quietly. The slender smooth stick felt unnaturally cold in my hands. Mine was smaller than Rose’s because I was younger. The older we grew, the bigger our cane got. Rose had joked once that one day her cane would be as big as an electric pole. I hadn’t found it funny. I walked back to the parlour, trembling all over. I handed the cane over to her. Uncle Chime just sat there looking.</p>
            <p>“Mummy, I’m sorry...” But she’d already started turning me around. I closed my eyes and waited for the pain. Soon enough the first lash landed on my buttocks. It wasn’t as painful as I had anticipated but I cried out anyway. Maybe if I did that, she’ll feel she’s flogging me well and leave me after a few lashes. But no. Ten lashes later, she didn’t seem like she was going to stop. As she flogged me for the eleventh time, I screamed in pain. My buttocks felt like a thousand soldier ants were stinging them. Mummy didn’t seem to care when I dropped to the floor, writhing and pleading for her to forgive me. I wasn’t going to do it again. I swore, I promised, I begged. But she didn’t stop until she’d counted twenty. Then she ordered me to go apologize to Uncle Chime. Teary eyed and still clutching my buttocks, I crawled over to where he was.</p>

            <p>
              “Uncle...I’m...I’m sorry. I....I won’t―”
            </p>
            <p>
              “C’mon talk like a human being before I flog you again!”
            </p>
            <p>
              I promptly stifled my sobs and spoke, somewhat clearly, “Uncle, I’m sorry. I...I won’t do it again.” He didn’t look at me. He just muttered something while staring at his feet. I turned to mummy to know if I should leave. She tossed the cane at my feet then shouted at me to get out of the parlour.  
            </p>
            <p>
              After that day, I tried my best to steer clear of Uncle. He was still nice to me but I knew all that wouldn’t help me if mummy got angry at me again so, I kept my distance. The night-time noises never stopped. But I never dared ask about them again. I never dared ask about a lot of things, like how Uncle Chime always went to hide in mummy’s bedroom when any of our relatives visited in the evenings. One time, my aunt slept over and he was stuck in mummy’s room for almost a full day. Neither did I ask why he kept telling the person that he saved on his phone as “Wifee” that he was in one conference or the other and that she should greet Junior for him. I kept to myself most of the time, even in school. My teacher told mummy that I wasn’t as lively as before, Mummy said she was sure I was just missing my dad, that she’ll talk to me when we got back home. I couldn’t sit properly on a chair for two days after that. 
            </p>
            <p>
              When April reached, Rose came back for the Easter holiday. I told her everything. Except the part about the noises, I felt she didn’t need to know that. She heard them that night though and we both cried ourselves to sleep. The next morning, it all happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day had started like every normal Sunday, with Mummy shouting that we’ll be late and Rose hissing behind our bedroom door. Trouble started brewing when Uncle Chime came out, wearing a brown traditional attire. I had no idea they were daddy’s clothes but apparently Rose did, because she immediately sat down on the long sofa and pulled off her church shoes.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Rose, ishi odigi nma?2 Why are you sitting back down as if you don’t know we are going to church?” I was surprised mummy didn’t start with beating her first. Maybe because it was a Sunday
            </p> 
            <p>
              “Mummy, I don’t know what you and this man are doing o but he is not going to wear my father’s clothes,” I concluded that Rose had either ran mad or just wanted to die. Ishi odigi nma? : Is your head okay? My mother was shocked beyond words. She calmly dropped her handbag and looked at Rose again.
            </p>
            <p>
               “Roseline, what did you just say?”
            </p>
            <p>
               “Mummy, I said there is no way this man will wear my father’s clothes. Ah ah! What
                is this sef? The both of you go around looking like love struck teenagers. A widow
                with kids, a married man with kids! Don’t you two have any shame? Ehn? At least
                have the decency to hide now! Somebody will be hearing your disgusting sounds
                throughout the―” The slap that landed on Rose’s cheeks could be heard from a mile
                away. I flinched when I saw the red outline of mummy’s fingers on them. Rose
                promptly let out a short scream and rubbed her cheeks furiously, but she still sat
                down. Mummy dragged her to the floor and kept on beating her, all the while
                shouting about how we didn’t care for her happiness and how she would never had
                done this to her mother. Rose was screaming on the floor, writhing back and forth as
                blow after blow landed on her body. I started crying.
            </p>
            <p>
               “Mummy, please...please stop. Mummy, please she’ll not do it again. Mummy!” she wasn’t even listening to me so I grabbed the right leg of Uncle Chime’s trouser, “Uncle please now. Uncle beg mummy. She’ll kill Rose. Uncle do something, please.”
            </p>
            <p>
              For the first time, Uncle Chime actually did something. He grabbed Mummy by the waist and lifted her up from Rose’s body. Mummy kept on kicking and flaying her hands in the air. Rose stood up from the floor and ran to the kitchen. Mummy was still screaming.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Chime allow me to kill this girl! What sort of temptation is this one? Ingrates!
              Ingrates!! That’s what they are. Useless children. They want me to die of
              depression!! Hey, where is that girl? Chime, leave me!”
                          </p>
            <p>
              The next few seconds moved slowly. Rose came out of the kitchen, holding our
              pestle and shouting at the top of her lungs, Uncle Chime left mummy and tried to
              stop her... next thing I heard was a loud crack sound and Uncle Chime fell to the
              floor.
            </p>

            <p><strong>#</strong></p>
            <p>“Mummy, where are we going?” Rose shushed me. We’d been driving for hours since we left the house and Uncle Chime’s body.</p>

            <p>“We’re going on a trip, Lisa,” Mummy’s voice was strangely calm. She was even
            smiling a little. Rose didn’t even look up. She was staring at her hands and rubbing
            them at intervals.</p>
            <p>“Mummy? Are you okay?” This time Mummy chuckled.</p>
            <p>“Yes Lisa, I’m Ok,” then she took her hands off the steering wheel.</p>
