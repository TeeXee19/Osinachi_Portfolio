             "You didn't do the assignment?" I couldn't hide the surprise in my voice. The whole class
              was holding bated breaths as well. One could literally slice through the tension in the
              room.
            </p>
            <p>
               "I just told you I didn't. Can I sit down now?" I kept staring at my 'prize' student. Kachi had totally transformed. Her hair used to be in neat cornrows... Now there was a bandana that was trying (and failing) to keep it in check. Added to that, she was wearing bright red lipstick and noisily chewing and popping gum, things she never did before. How could a one month break change someone so thoroughly?
             </p>
            <p>
              "Okay... You can sit down." As she did, I noticed she turned back and smiled at Jide, who gave her a knowing nod. I sighed in exasperation. Not again.
            </p>
            <p>Class went on as usual, except for the frequent snide remarks Kachi made which were immediately followed by a nod or cheer of affirmation from Jide at the back. I eventually had to ask her to leave the class, something I'd never done since I'd started teaching this set of SS2 students Geography.
            </p>
            <p>After my class, the bell rang for lunch break. My best time of the day. But today, I wasn'thalf as excited as I usually am. Kachi was bothering me. As the students chattered noisily out of the class, she sauntered back in, towards Jola who was waiting for her.
            </p>
            <p>"Kachi?" The look she gave me could cut through lead. I didn't care anyway. </p>
            <p>"Come. Let's have a talk... Jide, you too."</p>
            <p>They both dragged their feet to stand in front of me. </p>
            <p>"So... Are you dating now?" Kachi instantly started blushing while Jide looked flushed.
            </p>
            <p>"Hmm, Sir that's none of your business o," Jide replied but it was already too late. Their reactions had given them away. I sighed then rubbed my eyes.</p>

            <p>"Yes, I know it's not. But your attitude to studies is my business. Kachi, you can go for break. Let me talk to Jide."</p>
            <p>They exchanged surprised glances then she walked out of the class.</p>
            <p>"Sir, I need to eat o. I'm hungry," Jide muttered under his breath. I had gotten used to
            getting this sort of attitude sometimes. That's what happens when you're the youngest
            teacher in school. There was even an SS3 student that was older than me. The only
            good side to it was that I could have conversations like the one I was about to have now
            without sounding weird.</p>
            <p>"Yea, you'll eat. First, let's talk about Kachi."</p>
            <p>"She's turning 18 next month. She's practically an adult now. She can make decisions
            for herself, "Jide replied quickly. He was still a puzzle to me. He seemed like your typical
            rebel. Piercings, bushy hair, rude attitude. Born into a rich home and claimed he wasgoing to be a musician so he didn't need an education. The catch was that the boy was
            crazy smart. He was literally an award magnet. That's probably the only reason he was
            still in the school, despite his truancy. I'd actually been the one that told Kachi to let him
            teach her Mathematics during the break, despite her misgivings towards him. Now look
            what I'd caused.</p>

            <p>"OK. So you've decided to ruin her life then?" Subtlety never worked on Jide so I never
            used it. Sure enough, his eyes narrowed and he stared coldly back at me.</p>
            <p>"What are you implying, Sir?"</p>
            <p>"Come on, you're smart. You know what happens after a bright student starts neglecting
            his or her studies."</p>
            <p>"Sir forget that thing. School doesn't determine success."</p>
            <p>"Easy for you to say. Your dad is stinking rich. Kachi is the only child of her parents.
            She's on a scholarship. School is literally the only thing keeping her off the streets. You
            really don't want to be the one to cause a terrible change in her life. "</p>
            <p>I could tell I was getting to him cos he kept on staring at his feet. In a last attempt to
            save face, he replied me.</p>
            <p>"So I'm now a bad influence?"</p>
            <p>"Well, you don't have to be. You could help her become serious with her books again.
            That's what real men do, y'know? Develop people."</p>
            <p>That caught him. He beamed and promised to do just that. Few days later and Kachiwas back to the respectful, serious student we all knew and loved. That's my job.
            Teacher, counsellor, father. All in a day's work.</p>
