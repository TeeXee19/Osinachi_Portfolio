           <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re saying that Uzor prefers &lsquo;Sophie&rsquo;to you?&rdquo; Kaima asked me, her eyebrows furrowed in that way it usually is when something she doesn&rsquo;t understand happens, like when she was made &lsquo;Employee of the month&rsquo; last May.
           <p>&ldquo;Well, at least he was sincere about the breakup. He said I&rsquo;m too&hellip; earthy,&rdquo; If I could furrow my brows too, at this point I would have.</p>>
           <p>&ldquo;Earthy?! What does that even mean?&rdquo;</p>

           &ldquo;Kaima, if I knew, I would&rsquo;ve told you. But I don&rsquo;t&hellip; so please stop asking me questions so I<br />can take the elevator up to our apartment with some level of dignity? I can&rsquo;t cry here, my<br />eyeliner isn&rsquo;t waterproof and I know carbon is good for the skin but&hellip;&rdquo; Who was I even<br />kidding? I was already crying into her neck. I didn&rsquo;t care if we were on an elevator and<br />someone could come in any second. Wouldn&rsquo;t be the worst thing that happened to me today<br />anyway.<br />Kaima patted my backas she consoled me. &ldquo;Hey, Bubu, stop crying. If Uzor didn&rsquo;t know what<br />he had in you, well&hellip;he&rsquo;s more hopeless than a purewater hawker on Third Mainland Bridge,&rdquo;<br />I couldn&rsquo;t help it. I just had to laugh.<br />&ldquo;What on earth is a purewater hawker doing on Third Mainland Bridge?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;My point exactly,&rdquo; she said with a smile and gave me her handkerchief to dry my tears just<br />as the elevator door opened on our floor and we stepped out into the hallway. As we walked<br />down to the end of the corridor where our apartment was, I couldn&rsquo;t help feeling blessed to<br />have a bestfriend like her. Chikaima and I had known ourselves since junior secondary<br />school when she was always getting bullied for being a rich kid in a middle class girl&rsquo;s<br />boarding school in Enugu. What she had been doing there in the first place was still a<br />mystery to me. We clicked instantly because of our writing skills and shared interests in<br />books. Then coincidentally, both our families moved to Lagos so we never stopped seeing<br />each other. We didn&rsquo;t go to the same school again however, probably because her father<br />earned a six to seven figures salary and mine earned exactly five figures. Kaima always said<br />it was because they both had different views towards education. While I went to a standard<br />senior secondary school and university to &lsquo;learn,pass and get a job to feed myself&rsquo;, Kaima<br />first went to an arts school and then to an actual writing college. I didn&rsquo;t even know those<br />existed in Nigeria. I graduated with First class honours in Law but all I really wanted to do<br />was write. My dad didn&rsquo;t want to listen but Kaima did. She sent my CV and written works to<br />the same magazine she was applying for in New York, we both got jobs there and now...<br />well, my brother wants to be a musician and Dad is helping him buy instruments. All in all,<br />life was moving perfectly. Until Uzor...<br />&ldquo;Hey, earthy! The fact that there are no mosquitoes in America is no reason to leave the<br />door wide open like that. Come inside joor.&rdquo; Stepping into our apartment was like going<br />backhome. From the portrait of Bright Chimezie above our flat screen TV, to the red Isiagu<br />material we cut and somehow sew into pillow covers for our monochrome chair set. I<br />always felt that touch was extra but there&rsquo;s no stopping Kaima. I sat down heavily on the<br />couch and took off my stilettos.<br />&ldquo;What are you having? There&rsquo;s ofe oha in the fridge. But I can make yam and red oil for you. I<br />know that&rsquo;s your comfort food,&rdquo; Kaima had already changed to her casual clothes and was<br />leaning on the door leading from her room into the living room.<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to eat.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Hmm, what about nkwobi? It would be hard to get and pretty expensive too but if it&rsquo;s gonna<br />cheer you up then―&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;What do you think he meant by earthy? Is it the hair? Should I relax it? Or invest in<br />weave-ons or something?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;No, no, no. Come on, Ebube. You know better than this.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;But if he doesn&rsquo;t like the way I am then how sure am I that the next guy will? I&rsquo;m 23 already<br />and you know what happens when an Igbo woman turns 25 without getting married. I really<br />don&rsquo;t want to go back home for an inquisition,&rdquo; I felt the tears coming up again. Kaima<br />crossed the room and sat on the couch beside me.<br />&ldquo;Did you just say &lsquo;...if he doesn&rsquo;t like the way you are...&rsquo;? What &lsquo;way&rsquo; are you exactly?<br />&ldquo;I dunno...traditional?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Wow. So... you prefer your hair natural and you prefer highlife to hip hop? I doubt if that&rsquo;s a<br />terrible thing. That&rsquo;s how you were raised. It&rsquo;s who you are. If he doesn&rsquo;t like it, then he<br />should get lost.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;But, he&rsquo;s Igbo too. And he doesn&rsquo;t go all out like we do―&rdquo; I pointed at the centre table &ldquo;―<br />look. Even our side stools and centre table are replicas of the ones you saw in a chief&rsquo;s obi<br />in Enugu,&rdquo;<br />Kaima rolled her eyes at me, &ldquo;Yes, I know our apartment looks like a mini Igbo-ukwu shrine.<br />But you love it just as much as I do. Uzor may be Igbo, but he&rsquo;s not as connected to the<br />culture as we are. That&rsquo;s literally the only thing both our parents agree on. Probably the only<br />reason why they let us keep being friends in the first place.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Well, that and the fact that your mum makes the best achicha my father has ever tasted,&rdquo;<br />Kaima and I burst out laughing. When we were done, she stood up from the couch and<br />turned to me,<br />&ldquo;Bubu, thing is, if he doesn&rsquo;t appreciate our culture, he doesn&rsquo;t appreciate you. And if he<br />doesn&rsquo;t appreciate you, he&rsquo;s really not meant for you. Besides, what would your dad say when<br />he finds out you changed yourself for some alleged Igbo dude that can&rsquo;t speak Igbo and<br />hates ofe onugbu?&rdquo; She paused for effect. I nearly rolled my eyes. Kaima was such a<br />drama queen.<br />&ldquo;Biko, I&rsquo;ve heard you. Can you go and microwave the soup now? Agụụ na-agụ m,&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost energy to cook. I&rsquo;m going to order pizza,&rdquo; and she began to walk back to her room. I<br />stared in shock for a few seconds then quickly grabbed her hand.<br />&ldquo;So after all this talk about culture and being yourself and all what not, you&rsquo;re going to order<br />pizza?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Nwanne, nke ahu gbasara gi o. Ike agwula m.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;You know what? I&rsquo;ll do it myself. Need to keep my hands busy anyway.&rdquo;<br />As I walked to the kitchen, I made a promise to myself. Maybe dancing to OsondiOwendi<br />instead of Bodak Yellow made me seem weird. Maybe wearing red beads on my wrist made<br />me look like a lost diviner in New York. But that&rsquo;s what I was raised to appreciate and love. I<br />wouldn&rsquo;t toss my culture aside for anything or anyone...</p>
