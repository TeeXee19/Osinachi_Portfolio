                <p >“Eh… I know we did but… Ajoke is the one that holds my heart now.”</p>

                <p >“But Ajoke doesn’t know how to dance! She doesn’t know how to do anything! Going about, flaunting the jewellery she gets from her white man,” I was lying. Before the white man came, everyone knew Ajoke for her swaying hips. She never missed a beat when the talking drums sounded. That was what made the white man notice her in the first place. But all that didn’t matter to me. I couldn’t lose my love to a white woman to-be.</p>

                <p >“He’s not her white man. He just loves her dancing. Who wouldn’t? When she dances, it’s like she becomes one with the music… Her every move is a sight to behold, her feet…” and he kept on talking with that nostalgic, far away look on his face. His eyes were lit up with obvious admiration and she wasn’t even here with him…</p>

                <p >“I need to stop wasting brain cells on all these cliché books…”</p>

                <p >Her phone rang. The caller ID read Tony Friendzone. Kim ignored it and took a sip of her juice.</p>
